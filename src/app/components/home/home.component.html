    Anarchy is a Direct Democracy tool, allowing you to suggest changes, and/or vote on
    specific cases, either locally in your own village, or globally.
    After you have registered, you will be asked to follow a KYC process, where we will
    be asking you for some documents to prove your identity. This is because we want
    the system to become as legal as possible, resulting in that it becomes impossible
    for the government to ignore your votes, and such that all votes can be audited,
    and verified.
